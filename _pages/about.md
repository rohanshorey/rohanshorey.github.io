Hello there! While I do have a long long name, everyone mostly knows me as Toni. I was born in Italy and lived there until I was around 19 years old. I grew up in an amazing little town called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/visit_fano/">Fano <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a> ( <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TUaqGh5np22fPjAM8">Map <i class="fa-solid fa-map"></i></a> ) , by the beach luckily unbeknownst to most people. If you love green hill with sunflowers, vines, and olive trees, where you can gaze the prettiest Adriatic sea, this city could be for you as well ðŸ˜‰

Once graduated high school, my grandfather (Nonno), jokingly but not too jokingly kidnapped me and brought me to Seattle, Washington, in the US to start my aerospace engineering studies. After all, the first thing he said when he first held me was "you are gonna become an aerospace engineer like your grandpa"; and here I am.

I finished my bachelor at University of Washington Seattle (UW) and initially intended to continue my graduate studies at Imperial College, moving back to once Europe (UK, what are you doing?!?). However, while visiting my ex-girlfriend in China, I had a phone call with Prof. Marco Salviato at UW, where he offered me a Ph.D. position if I wanted to continue there. I finally decided to stay in Seattle and in the summer of 2023 I finally finished my Ph.D.

And oh, that ex-girlfriend is now my wife ([#technically-the-truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicallythetruth/)) met 11 years ago, married for 3, with our first beautiful baby.

In the last two years of my Ph.D I started working with ES3, developing cutting edge computational discrete models for composites. After graduating I was offered an amazing position at the company at the headquarter in San Diego. We moved in the 2023 Fall and currently enjoying the best weather and climate anyone can ask for. If you ever come vist, reach out and we'll bring you around!
