I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/suhas-mahesh/) at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholars/rhodes-scholars-class-of-2016/suhas-mahesh/) at the University of Oxford where I completed my [PhD in Condensed Matter Physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/mahesh).

I unite **experiments**, **computation**, and **machine learning (ML)** to develop materials for **clean energy**, particularly **photovoltaics**. My research is outward-facing, engaging with the public, industry, and policymakers.

Want to collaborate? Hear about my science? Chat about a problem you have? Get in touch: [suhas.mahesh@utoronto.ca](mailto:suhas.mahesh@utoronto.ca).

I moonlight as an expert of classical Sanskrit and Prakrit. Check out my book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205425671-how-to-love-in-sanskrit"><i>How to Love in Sanskrit</i></a> (HarperCollins 2024). Under contract: Nilakantha's Victory for HUP's Murty Classical Library. I'm also a co-creator of [ambuda.org](https://www.ambuda.org)

<!-- SEAN!!!. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
