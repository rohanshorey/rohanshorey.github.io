I am a **materials physicist** building **self-driving labs** using AI to accelerate materials discovery in **photovoltaics**, **semiconductors** and **catalysis**, driving towards decarbonization. 

I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/suhas-mahesh/) at the University of Toronto. I have a [PhD in Condensed Matter Physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/mahesh) from the University of Oxford where I was a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholars/rhodes-scholars-class-of-2016/suhas-mahesh/). I am also an Acceleration Consortium Fellow, Faculty Affiliate Researcher at the Vector Institute, and visiting researcher at Oxford University.

Some favourite past work: the [first triple-junction solar cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2019.01.007) deposited fully from inks, [using detailed balance theory](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9EE02162K) to resolve a hotly debated semiconductor phase segregation problem, and an influential long-form [technical assessment](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-019-0097-0) of the photovoltaics field.

I moonlight as an expert of classical Sanskrit and Prakrit. Check out my book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205425671-how-to-love-in-sanskrit"><i>How to Love in Sanskrit</i></a> (HarperCollins 2024)<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>. Under contract: Nilakantha's Victory for HUP's Murty Classical Library. I'm also a co-creator of [ambuda.org](https://www.ambuda.org)

<a name="footnote1">2. </a> [Book 30 mins](https://calendar.app.google/JSuvvguzZFAUuCar8) on my calendar. No agenda needed. Some things I've done during such meetings: give feedback on projects and applications, explain how I learnt something, brainstorm potential projects, catch-up with old friends, general chit-chat about a common interest.
