# Toni Deleo Personal Website (Still Work-in-Progress!)

Hello there! I have used the [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/) theme for this website, so go check it out if you like this jekyll project!

I have added a few JS libraries to spice it up a bit:
- [Particle JS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
- [Simple Parallax JS](https://simpleparallax.com/)
- [Typed JS](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js)

Note that I am not a web-developer nor a real software guy, so things might have been done quickly (trust me tho, I am an engineer!)

I know there a few bugs here and there, but everything seems almost to work great!

- [x] Particle JS updates colors based on theme settings automatically
- [x] Top menu bar shakes a tiny bit while on hover
- [x] Page header text slides in from right to left and increases size on hover (need to fix div lenght)
- [x] Dark Reader API integration for dark theme detection
- [ ] Simple Parallax JS is a bit slow, need to figure out a way to improve the performance
